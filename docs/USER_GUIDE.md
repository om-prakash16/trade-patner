# 📘 NG Trade Analysis - User Guide & Functional Overview

## 🌟 Introduction: The Purpose of This System

**"Why does this system exist?"**

Most trading platforms (like Kite, Groww, Upstox) are built for **execution**—to buy and sell. They are *not* built for **analysis**. They give you a list of 500 stocks and leave you to figure out which one to trade.

**The NSE F&O Analyzer stands in the gap between Data and Decision.**

*   **The Problem**: A trader cannot manually check the RSI, MACD, and 3-Day Trend of 200 F&O stocks every minute.
*   **The Solution**: This system does the math for you. It scans the entire market every second, calculates a "Strength Score," and presents only the actionable data.

## 1. The Dashboard: Your Command Center

The Dashboard is designed for **Situational Awareness**. It answers the question: *"What is the market doing right now?"*

### Key Functions:
*   **Market Ticker**: The scrolling tape at the top gives you the heartbeat of the Nifty/Sensex.
*   **Top Gainers/Losers**: Instantly see which stocks are leading the rally or the crash.
*   **Market Watch**: A curated list of active stocks.

## 2. God Mode: The "Killer Feature"

This is why we built the app. **God Mode** aggregates disjointed data into a single, cohesive narrative.

### Why is this better?
Normally, to get this data, you would need to open 5 different charts. Here, it is in one row.
*   **Today Str (Strength)**: Tells you intraday momentum.
*   **P1/P2/P3**: Shows history. Consistently Green = **Strong Uptrend**.
*   **Visual Cues**: Green backgrounds mean "Buy", Red means "Sell". No guessing required.

## 3. Intelligent Filtering

We don't just use text filters. We use **Financial Context Filters**.

### Feature Spotlight: "Smart Dropdowns"
*   Notice in the screenshot how the filter options aren't just numbers. They are **Categories**.
*   You can filter for **"Bullish"**, **"Bearish"**, or **"Neutral"**.
*   This abstraction allows a beginner to trade like a pro without knowing the exact RSI formula.
