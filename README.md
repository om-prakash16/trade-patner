**A professional-grade real-time market analytics platform designed for the modern trader.**

Trade Partner is a high-performance web application that processes live market data to identify high-probability trading setups. Unlike traditional brokers that list thousands of stocks, this system uses an **intelligent filtering engine** to isolate the few stocks that matter right now.

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

In the fast-paced world of F&O (Futures & Options) trading, speed and clarity are everything. This project solves three critical problems:

1.  **Noise Reduction**: Instead of watching 200 stocks, highlights top "Moving" stocks.
2.  **Context-Aware Analysis**: Correlates Price Change with RSI and MACD.
3.  **Instant Decision Making**: Single glance trend analysis.

*   **📊 God Mode Dashboard**: A unified table view with multi-day performance metrics.
*   **🧠 Smart Strength Engine**: Automatically classifies stocks as **"Buyers Dominating"**, **"Sellers Dominating"**, or **"Neutral"**.
*   **🔍 Advanced Filtering**: Excel-style multi-column filtering.
*   **📉 Real-Time Options Chain**: Live Call/Put data analysis.
